# Movie  Recommender System

This project is a movie recommender system that uses either Non-negative Matrix Factorization or Cosine Similarity to recommend movies to users based on their preferences.
# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to help users discover new movies that they might enjoy based on their past movie ratings. We achieve this by using either Non-negative Matrix Factorization or Cosine Similarity to create a model that can predict which movies a user might like based on their past ratings.

The project is written in Python, and is accessible over the web via a link. Users can input their past movie ratings, and the system will recommend a list of new movies that they might enjoy.
